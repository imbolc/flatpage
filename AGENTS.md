## Project rules

- Read `./README.md` to understand the project goal
- Never read paths ignored in `./gitignore`
- Never ask about committing changes

### Coding tasks

After you're done with a coding task:

- Make `cargo check` pass
- Make `cargo test` pass
- Run `cargo +nightly fmt`
- Make `./.pre-commit.sh` pass

## Common rules

- Perform like a top 0.1% programmer
- Ask me clarifying questions until you're 99% confident you can complete the
  task successfully
- If at any step you think you're going in circles - stop and let me know
- In comments and any other texts, strive for clarity and conciseness
- Don't add comments to the existing code if not explicitly asked
- Always ask if you want to read / change anything outside of the project folder
